***SIMPLE! Website/Server using Go language***

Created this simple website using Golang and HTML while showing how to work with JSON in Go. 
The main objective was to show simple, well-rounded examples of a website/app while using common tools.
In this case, Golang, HTML, and Docker were used to show how fun and easy Golang and Docker can be! 

**It's very easy to spin this web service up:**

    - Just simply run the bash script included in the folder (```serve.sh```).
    - The bash script will run two commands: `docker-compose down` && `docker-compose up`
    - Alternatively, you can run these two commands manually in the terminal/command prompt/powershell. 
    - Then, visit ```localhost:8080``` in your favorite browser. 

*When using the Docker command(s), it's unnecessary to have Go installed and setup on your computer (THIS is one of the main beauties behind the bacon, which is GO!).*
