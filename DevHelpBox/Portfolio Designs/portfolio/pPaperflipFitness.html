                  We created a usability protocol that asks the user their first initial thoughts and impressions of the app, what its purpose is, followed by three tasks. In the end, we asked them to share their overall experience. Each team member conducted two usability tests on students who are college students that are familiar with the Co-Rec.

                *The bolded items will be the heuristics we will see in the Paperclip App. These will be defined, for simplicity, we will leave out the four heuristics that were either not violated or not evident in the app.

                <p>
                Each team member individually went through the heuristics and looked for troublesome areas that were mentioned previously by users in the usability test. We then tried to match the potential issues with a correlating heuristic. Severity was rated based on the frequency, persistent, and impact on usability. We did not do an evaluation on the feedback or report bug page as it is not something that would entice the users. In other words, it’s not the primarily part of the app.

            <div class="col-lg-9 col-md-9 wow fadeInLeft" data-wow-delay="1.4s">

                <p>
                Severity is rated based on a 0-4 scale. The rating number is based on frequency, persistence, and impact. It gives us a way to classify the heuristics and how severely they are violated. For instances where the severity was 0, we left it out because it does not indicate a problem.

              <br/>


                <li>

                <li>
                  3. On the dashboard there is no text to indicate what the icons mean. Some people felt like the phone icon was used to call someone with their phone. There is consistency and standard but it was a minor detail here.

                <li>

              <br/>


                <li>
              2.  Facility usage is a big part of the app, but areas are labeled as what the co-rec might official call them, not what the patrons (students) would call them.
                </li>
                <br/>

                <li>
              3.  It’s not an effective way to communicate the different levels to the user, there isn’t a quick way for them to see what’s on each floor. Users have to remember what’s on each floor, vs having them recognize level is the floor we come in from.

                    During the 15th week of our project, we met with Robert to go over Personas. It was at this time, Robert had told us of his decision to not partnering up with the Co-rec at this time. He wanted Paperclip Fitness to be a standalone app that would provide value and benefits to the patrons on it’s own.

                    This meant some changes for us too…

                    We were not longer bounded by Purdue Branding guides, this meant that we have to create a separate style guide on how the app might look.

                    In order to provide the best value to the patrons, Robert needed to incorporate more features into the app. This meant that we would have to redesign the structure of the app in order to include several more features instead of the original “Call a Fitcon” and “Facility Usage”.

                      We were granted access to a SurveyMonkey account courtesy of Robert. We designed our survey to be short and simple. We presented the six features along with a short description of their functionalities. We then asked the participants to rank them from 1 to 6. 1 would be the most desirable and 6 being the least desirable.

                          The warmer colors of red,orange, and yellow is exactly what Robert wants. We know that typically reds, in the Western world, tend to represent STOP or otherwise negative connotations. Because of this, we will most likely leave out red but use primarily the orange and yellow to get that energetic feel Robert is looking for.
